# Locally on Mac on 3.11 I have trouble installing lxml because tox uses my system Python
# instead of the pyenv one.  Buildout, which uses pip, cannot build a wheel for it.
# Installing it with pip first helps.  Really strange.
# I tried passenv=PATH which did not help, and tried tox-pyenv but that is incompatible with tox 4.
